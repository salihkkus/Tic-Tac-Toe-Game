# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built using **Unity**. This game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Two players take turns to play.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to navigate and understand.
- **Reset Functionality:** Restart the game after a win or a draw.
- **Simple Graphics:** Clean, minimalistic design focused on gameplay.

## Requirements
- **Unity:** The game is developed using Unity, so you will need Unity installed to run and modify the project.
- **C#:** The game is programmed in C# and all the game logic is handled through scripts in Unity.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses the **X** symbol and Player 2 uses the **O** symbol.
3. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their respective symbol in an empty spot.
4. The first player to line up three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all the spots are filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.
6. Players can click the **Reset** button to restart the game.
